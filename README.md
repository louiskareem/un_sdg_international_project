# International Project with students from Belgium and South Africa.
This is an Machine Learning project to predict waste images in the form of Organic and Recyclable wastes. My group consists of 6 students. I am the AI student that is resposible for the machine learning.

## What I Learned
* How to read image data
* Preparing data for prediction by using feature selection
* How to integrate Deep Learning's Convolutional Neural Network
* Evaluating model
* Saving model
* Data Version Control
* Test CNN model on unseen image data (see html files)
---
Yet to be integrated:

* Hyperparamter tuning for Deep Learning models
* Deploy model by using Django API or deploy model on Google Cloud Platform
