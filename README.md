# International Project with students from Belgium and South Africa.
This is an Machine Learning project to predict waste images in the form of Organic and Recyclable waste. My group is one of 6 other groups and consists of 6 students. I am the AI student that is resposible for the machine learning.

## What I Learned
* How to read image data
* Preparing data for prediction by using feature selection
* How to integrate Deep Learning's Convolutional Neural Network
* Evaluating model
* Saving model
* Data Version Control
* Test CNN model on unseen image data (see html files)
* Hyperparamter tuning for Deep Learning models
* How to deploy ML model using Flask
* How to integrate containerization with Docker
