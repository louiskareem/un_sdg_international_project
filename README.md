# International Project with students from Belgium and South Africa.
This is an Machine Learning project to predict waste images in the form of Organic and Recyclable waste. My group is one of 6 other groups and consists of 6 students. I am the AI student that is resposible for the machine learning.

## What I Learned
* How to read image data
* Preparing data for prediction by using feature selection
* How to integrate Deep Learning's Convolutional Neural Network
* Evaluating model
* Saving model
* Data Version Control
* Test CNN model on unseen image data (see html files)
* Hyperparamter tuning for Deep Learning models
* How to deploy ML model using Flask
* How to productionize model to an online environment, Heroku
* How to integrate containerization with Docker

There are two branches: main & deployment. Deployment branch is used for deploying the web app to Heroku. Main is used to showcase the work.

If you would like to test the model in production, here's the link: https://waste-classification-sdg.herokuapp.com/

<!-- Additionally, I added a feature to classify an image using your webcam by clicking the link in the app or going to this linke: https://waste-classification-sdg.herokuapp.com/webcam_feed This is feature temporarily removed -->
